			After reuniting with Gwen Stacy, Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man 
			is catapulted across the Multiverse, where he encounters a team of Spider-People 
			charged with protecting its very existence. However, when the heroes clash on how to 
			handle a new threat, Miles finds himself pitted against the other Spiders. He must 
			soon redefine what it means to be a hero so he can save the people he loves most.
